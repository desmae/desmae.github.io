    <h1>Guess That Item Chatbot</h1>
    <p>The Guess That Item Chat Bot (GTI Chat Bot) is currently being developed by me (Desmae) for people who want to engage their chat during Zelda: Ocarina of Time randomizer runs. 
       Viewers can guess upcoming items, earn points when they're right, and compete on a live leaderboard displayed in OBS. Mods can log obtained items manually with commands, 
       and all progress persists between streams. It is currently in a closed alpha, and is expected be released to the public some time in 2025. To follow and support development,
      visit <strong><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@desmae">my YouTube channel</a></i></strong> and keep an eye out for upcoming test streams where you can participate as a viewer!</p>
